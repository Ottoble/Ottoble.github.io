                    <h4>I am currently in my third year studying information technology.</br>
                        Since I was very young I have loved technology and always wanted to make it my career. 
                    </h4>
                    <p>I have been programming since I was 15 and have learned a plethora of skills and techniques since I started. 
                        Throughout the years I have learned much about data structures, algorithms and principles, best practices, program architecture, 
                        new languages as well as operating systems and hardware. All because I enjoy immersing myself in technology.</p>
