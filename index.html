            <h1><u>About Me: </u></h1>
            <h2>Hi, my name is Otto Yu and I am currently a student at York University</h2>
            <p>I am currently in my third year studying information technology.
                I have loved technology since I was very young and always knew I wanted to work with it as I grew up. 
            </p>
            <p>I have been programming since I was 15 and have learned a plethra of skills and techniqunes since I have started. 
                Throughout the years I have learned much about data structures, algorithems and principles, best practices, program architecture, 
                new languages as well as operating systems and hardware. All because I enjoy emersing myself in technology.
            </p>
